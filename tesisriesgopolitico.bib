  abstract = {Abstract   In response to the lessons of the global financial crisis, macroprudential policy is now firmly established as a financial policy area to prevent excessive risk taking in the financial sector and mitigate its effects on the real economy. However, macroprudential policy is facing several challenges relating to its political sensitivity and institutional context. These include political and interest group resistance, weaknesses in the governance framework, and limited institutional memory among policy makers. This project seeks to contribute to the contextual understanding of macroprudential policy by exploring how factors relating to these challenges influence policy in the EU. More specifically, it develops and empirically tests a number of hypotheses on how wider institutional and structural factors influence the actual use of macroprudential measures across Europe. The findings yield considerable support for theoretical predictions that institutions and contexts matter - Political pressure and interest group resistance tend to influence the intensity of macroprudential policy stances. Weaker policy stances characterise countries where banking systems depend on domestic banks, whereas the opposite holds for financial systems with significant market shares of other financial intermediaries. Results on institutional arrangements show that governance arrangements on relating to transparency influence policy stances. The results also indicate that policy makers' inertia is best counteracted by appointing a single macroprudential authority. The results differ somewhat depending on whether countries are based in the Euro zone or not. This suggests that policy frameworks that are multi-layered complex pose tricky conundrums on how to ensure sufficient institutional autonomy, policy capacity and discretion among macroprudential authorities. This also has implications on other policy areas macroprudential policy, such as microprudential policy, crisis management and fiscal policy.},

  abstract = {One of the fastest growing areas of research in international business has been political risk assessment. Concerned primarily with the identification, analysis, and management of sociopolitical and governmental restraints on foreign investment, the discipline has flourished in the wake of the international turmoil of recent years. An integral stage in the development of any new field is the establishment of a theoretical base upon which further research can build. This paper thus addresses itself to theoretical and conceptual issues in political risk assessment, focusing on the interrelationship of strategies, goals, and capabilities of key actors, as well as the impact of different environments on the formation of political risk. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach set forth in this paper, political risk in the Republic of South Africa is examined.},

  abstract = {Abstact This contribution deals with state capture, political risks and international business both from the perspective of Political Science and International Business Studies and asks how political risk factors impact international business activities in post-Soviet markets. International operations are per se associated with additional risks for companies. A new environment different from the well-known home-market combined with a political and institutional framework which the organization is less acquainted with, makes international business more complex, and riskier. Political risk is a concept that covers those risk factors for international companies that are rooted in the political and institutional environment of a country but have immediate consequences on the company's performance.},
